# Crowdfunding ETL

This project demonstrates the ability to build an **ETL pipeline** using Python, **Pandas**, and Python dictionary methods to process crowdfunding data. After processing the data and creating four cleaned CSV files, a **PostgreSQL database schema** was generated to upload the CSV data into a **Postgres database**.

## Repository Structure

- **ETL_Pipeline**:
  - **ETL_Mini_ProjectCNunez**: This file contains the code to transform the original CSV files into four cleaned CSV files.
  - **crowdfunding_db_scheme.sql**: SQL code generated using the QuickDBD tool, representing the database schema.

- **Resources Folder**: 
  - Contains the necessary **CSV files** used to create the new cleaned CSV files.

- **Output Folder**: 
  - Contains the four cleaned CSV files generated by the ETL pipeline.

## Instructions to Run the Files

### 1. Set Up the Database and Tables

**Open and Execute the Schema Script:**

1. Open **PGAdmin** and create a new database called `crowdfunding_db`.
2. Open the `crowdfunding_db_scheme.sql` file in your new `crowdfunding_db`.

   **Before executing the schema script**, run the following SQL `DROP` statements to ensure the tables can be re-created:
   
   ```sql
   DROP TABLE IF EXISTS campaign;
   DROP TABLE IF EXISTS category;
   DROP TABLE IF EXISTS contacts;
   DROP TABLE IF EXISTS subcategory;
